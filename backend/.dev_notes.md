I think what matters is:
- Do I have my own pick
- Do I have the pick / protections
  - Extension
- Swap
  Do I get a good swap or bad swap

- all available picks
  - not traded away
  - include
    - swapped
    - 

Available also relies on pick laws

Hierarchy:
- unprotected pick
- protected pick
- unprotected better swap
- protected better swap
- protected worse swap
- unprotected worse swap
x traded-away protected pick
x traded-away unprotected pick

Available Picks:
- unprotected pick
- protected pick
- 

Available Swaps:
- unprotected better swap
- protected better swaps

We need a better word than available

Owned Picks
- unprotected pick (with and without better swaps)
- protected pick (with and without better swaps)

Tradable picks
- of owned picks, follow stephian rule to get tradable picks

  originator: MIA
  protections: [
    { MIA: 1-10 },
    { OKC: 11-30 },
  ]
  conveysTo: [
