## Instructions

- Always use TypeScript. We want clean, type-safe code
- Prioritize cohesion. We want to build from many low complexity, high cohesion functions/files rather than having long functions and files.
- Use esmodules (import/export) syntax, not commonjs (require)
- Be sure to lint and typecheck after you write code to make sure it matches our standards
  - Lint: `pnpm run lint --fix`
  - Type Check: `pnpm run typecheck`
