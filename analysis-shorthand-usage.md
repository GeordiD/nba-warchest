## Manual Entry Categories

### 1. Protected Picks (68 entries - 47% of manual entries)
**Description:** Picks with protection conditions and complex conveyance logic

**Examples:**
- ATL R2: "One of BOS / IND / MIA / MIN / NYK / NOP / POR"
- ATL R1: "Least favorable of MIL ${prot(4)} and NOP ${prot(4)}"
- BKN R2: "One of LAC / BOS / IND / MIA"
- CHI R1: "POR ${prot(14)}" (with complex conveyance)

**Assessment:** ‚ùå **Cannot be easily converted** - These require complex conditional logic and detailed explanations

### 2. Multi-team Swaps (45 entries - 31% of manual entries)
**Description:** Complex swap arrangements involving multiple teams and conditions

**Examples:**
- ATL R1: "Own (swap with SAS / CLE / UTA / MIN)"
- ATL R1: "Swap with UTA / CLE"
- BKN R1: "Own (${unfavorableSwap} HOU)"
- BOS R2: "Own (${unfavorableSwap} with better of IND / MIA)"

**Assessment:** ‚ùå **Cannot be easily converted** - These involve complex multi-party logic that requires custom implementation

### 3. Simple Custom Entries (22 entries - 15% of manual entries)
**Description:** Simple entries that could potentially use shorthand functions

**Examples:**
- BOS R2: "To OKC" (simple trade)
- BOS R1: "Own (frozen through 2027-28)" (frozen pick)
- CHA R2: "Best of POR / NOP" (simple favorable swap)
- CHA R2: "Best of LAC / UTA" (simple favorable swap)
- DET R2: "Worst of BKN / DAL" (simple unfavorable swap)

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ **Could be converted** - These could benefit from new shorthand functions like:
- `frozenPick(year)` for frozen picks
- `bestOf(team1, team2)` for simple favorable swaps
- `worstOf(team1, team2)` for simple unfavorable swaps

### 4. Multi-team Picks (10 entries - 7% of manual entries)
**Description:** Picks involving 3+ teams in relatively simple arrangements

**Examples:**
- BKN R1: "Worst of DAL / PHX / HOU"
- BOS R2: "Most favorable of MIN / NYK / NOP / POR"
- HOU R2: "To OKC / SAS / MIA / NYK"

**Assessment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Possibly convertible** - Could benefit from expanded shorthand functions like:
- `worstOf(...teams)` for multiple team unfavorable
- `bestOf(...teams)` for multiple team favorable
- `tradePick([...teams])` for multi-team trades

## Conversion Opportunities

### High Priority Teams (Need Improvement)
1. **BOS (47% shorthand)** - 9 manual entries, several could be converted
2. **WAS (52% shorthand)** - 10 manual entries
3. **MIN (53% shorthand)** - 8 manual entries
4. **MEM (56% shorthand)** - 7 manual entries
5. **LAC (57% shorthand)** - 6 manual entries

### Potential New Shorthand Functions
Based on the analysis, these new functions could help convert ~22 entries:

```typescript
// For frozen picks
export const frozenPick = (year: number): PickMeta => ({
  details: `Own (frozen through ${year-1}-${year.toString().slice(-2)})`,
  summary: {
    isOwn: true,
    frozen: year,
  },
});

// For simple 2-team favorable swaps
export const bestOf = (team1: TeamAbbr, team2: TeamAbbr): PickMeta => ({
  details: `Best of ${team1} / ${team2}`,
  summary: {
    swapType: 'favorable',
    teams: [team1, team2],
  },
});

// For simple 2-team unfavorable swaps
export const worstOf = (team1: TeamAbbr, team2: TeamAbbr): PickMeta => ({
  details: `Worst of ${team1} / ${team2}`,
  summary: {
    swapType: 'unfavorable',
    teams: [team1, team2],
  },
});

// For simple multi-team favorable
export const bestOfMany = (...teams: TeamAbbr[]): PickMeta => ({
  details: `Most favorable of ${teams.join(' / ')}`,
  summary: {
    swapType: 'favorable',
    teams: teams,
  },
});

// For simple multi-team unfavorable  
export const worstOfMany = (...teams: TeamAbbr[]): PickMeta => ({
  details: `Worst of ${teams.join(' / ')}`,
  summary: {
    swapType: 'unfavorable',
    teams: teams,
  },
});
```

## Summary & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
- **71% overall conversion rate** - Great progress on shorthand adoption
- **Several teams above 85%** - CHI, TOR, CLE, GSW, MIA, BKN are exemplary
- **Clear patterns** - Most remaining manual entries have legitimate complexity

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **5 teams below 60%** - BOS, WAS, MIN, MEM, LAC need attention
- **22 simple entries** could be converted with new shorthand functions
- **Consistency gaps** - Some teams haven't fully adopted existing shorthand

### üéØ Next Steps
1. **Create new shorthand functions** for the 5 patterns identified above
2. **Focus conversion efforts** on the 5 lowest-performing teams
3. **Document complex entries** that legitimately cannot be converted
4. **Consider team-specific helpers** for recurring patterns within teams

### üí° Key Insight
The 29% remaining manual entries are mostly **legitimately complex** scenarios that require custom logic. The shorthand system has successfully captured the majority of standard pick scenarios, and only ~15% of remaining entries could realistically be converted with additional helper functions.
