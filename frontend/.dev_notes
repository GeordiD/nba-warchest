Todo:

* Add `cursor-pointer` to title
* Real tooltip library

* Design
  * Add numbers to table
  * Better swap iconography
  * Total picks

* Analytics
  * Would be real cool to see which teams get the most traffic

* Site Map
  * About page
  * I need some sort of cool graph outlet, but maybe that's something else?



What's Important?

- Total Firsts: All firsts that aren't traded away (I don't think it should include conditionally traded away picks)
- Total Swaps: Any favorable swaps the team has
  - Probably include mixed
  - If you have a swap with 2 teams, then it counts as two
- Total Seconds
- Tradable Firsts
- Swappable Firsts
- Percentage of own picks the team owns

Team Owns
- Total Firsts
- Total Swaps
- Total Seconds
- Own % (??)

Team can trade
- Tradable Firsts
- Swapable Firsts
